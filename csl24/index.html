    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW) will introduce young researchers to the technical and practical aspects of a career in logic research.
      It is targeted at students, from senior undergraduates to graduates, and will include talks and panel sessions from leaders in the subject.
    </p>
    <h2>CSL Buddy</h2>
    <p>
      Is this the first conference you will attend in person? We have all been there.
      You might not feel comfortable if you don't know anyone.
      Join our Buddy Program, and we will help you to get in touch with another mentoring workshop attendee.
      Every newcomer will be assigned either a more experienced peer or another newcomer, so you are not alone.
      For those who are not attending a conference for the first time,
      being a buddy is a way for you to help the community to grow and introduce less experienced students to the field.
      If you are interested, <a href="mailto:steffen.van.bergerem@hu-berlin.de?Subject=LMW%20CSL%20Buddy">write us an email</a>.
