      Good student versus good researcher<br/>
      School trains students to adopt a certain attitude and discourage them to take some behaviours that on the contrary are extremely valuable in research. By comparing the profiles of the good student and the good researcher I will give some advice for the general practice of research.

      How to survive a “What is your research about?” kind of question<br/>
      Scientific venues are places where people do not only attend seminars and lectures, but also get in touch with colleagues from their (broadly conceived) academic domain. Chatting with academic people can sometimes be intimidating, or even weird, especially for young researchers. In this short talk I would like to interact with the audience about this subject, at the same time highlighting a few common obstacles.

      Let Me Be Clear<br/>
      Research is often confused with the sole process of discovering new results. However, another difficult task of the researcher's work starts after the "Eureka!" happens: share our discovery with somebody else. During this presentation, I will recall some tips to keep in mind when preparing talks and papers to improve accessibility to better engage the audience.

      <span class="font-bold">Maaike Zwart</span>:
      Storytelling at conferences - how to present your paper without losing your audience<br/>
      Papers, especially the ones accepted in top tier conferences, are full of new, highly technical results. How do you present so much and such advanced information in a mere 30 minutes or less, to an audience where only about 10% of people are familiar with the jargon of your particular field? The answer: you tell a story. In this talk I will explain how I use storytelling techniques to get the main ideas of my papers across to a diverse audience.

      Work-Family Balance in Academia? — Reflections on my PhD time as a parent<br/>
      I would like to talk about a topic that is rarely discussed openly and that I lacked role models before I tried it out myself: How well can a position at university be combined with having children? Is it possible to complete your doctorate (in a finite amount of time) despite care work? What pitfalls, but also: what advantages does a position in science offer? I will report on my experiences from my PhD and postdoc time with two small children.
    </p>

      <span class="font-bold">Iris van der Giessen</span>:
      Doing a PhD is more than writing a thesis<br/>
      The end of a PhD is marked by a PhD thesis, but a PhD is so much more! I would like to share the things that I learned during my PhD about logic, logicians, research, academic life, and about myself. I hope my experience can inspire and motivate other people starting/in their own PhD journey.
