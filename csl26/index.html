    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW) will introduce young researchers to the technical and practical aspects of a career in logic research.
      It is targeted at students, from senior undergraduates to graduates, and will include talks and panel sessions from leaders in the subject.
    </p>
	<h2>Conference and Workshop Registration</h2>
    <p>
		Registration will be done via the main CSL conference site. 
		Registering for the CSL2025 main conference includes registration for the workshop, if you do so please indicate that you are attending the LMW workshop as well.

	<h2>Student Sponsorship</h2>
    <p>
		Some scholarships will be funded by our sponsors (see below). 
		Scholarships are for students of all countries (undergraduate, master's and PhD) 
		to help cover the costs of workshop registration, travel and accommodation. 
		Due to generous funding by the NSF, we will additionally be able to fund several US-based students, 
		who are particularly encouraged to apply. 
		The deadline for applications is *December 20th, 2024* AoE (anywhere on earth). 
		Notification will be made before December 29th.

    <h2>CSL Buddy</h2>
    <p>
      Is this the first conference you will attend in person? We have all been there.
      You might not feel comfortable if you don't know anyone.
      Join our Buddy Program, and we will help you to get in touch with another mentoring workshop attendee.
      Every newcomer will be assigned either a more experienced peer or another newcomer, so you are not alone.
      For those who are not attending a conference for the first time,
      being a buddy is a way for you to help the community to grow and introduce less experienced students to the field.
	  If you are interested, <a href="mailto:niels.voorneveld@gmail.com?Subject=LMW%20CSL%20Buddy">write us an email with the subject "LMW CSL Buddy"</a>.
