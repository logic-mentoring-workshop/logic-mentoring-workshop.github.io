      What makes theoretical research interesting–relevant–exciting?<br/>
      I will give you my thoughts about just that: what makes theoretical
      research ...
      My main message: think about it for yourself!

      Nobody knows anything<br/>
      Up to and including undergraduate studies, our performance is evaluated by teachers, who we tend to think of as all-knowing entities. As a young – or old – researcher, this is no longer the case. In my talk, I will discuss this phenomenon and its practical consequences.

      Fighting for tenure<br/>
      We all know (or have heard) about the trials and tribulations of finding a tenured position. I want to share both my own experience of the process, and the significant amount I’ve learned since then! My hope is that this will help you in your own academic journey. As with all ‘advice’ talks, this talk will be necessary biased by my own experience.

      The Grant Application Survival Guide<br/>
      While obtaining funding to pursue one's own research is an appealing achievement, preparing a research project or a grant proposal might seem a challenging and daunting task. Relating to my personal experience, I will discuss the process of writing a grant application, illustrating some basic tools to successfully get through the process. The aim of the talk is to encourage the audience to apply for research grants, as this experience can be extremely interesting and motivating, other than being the first step in obtaining funding for research.

      What I learned through my PhD journey to industry<br/>
      Ten years ago, as I applied for my first PhD program in theoretical mathematics, I never could have anticipated that my path would lead me to become a developer at a self-driving startup instead of staying in academia. In this talk, I will share with you my journey through academia, highlighting lessons I learned the hard way. We will discuss the importance of networking, internship experiences and interview preparations. Additionally, we will highlight the pros and cons of transitioning from academia to industry and cover many tips that I hope can help you on your own journey.
